As a measure of risk factors, the Fama and French’s (1993) factors (High Minus Low, HML, and Small Minus Big, SMB) are considered in the analysis.

    "*In this paper, we rely on a large number of macroeconomic variables from the FRED-MD database of McCracken and Ng (2016) to forecast the aggregate oil futures market volatility. The FRED-MD is a comprehensive macroeconomic database consisting of more than 100 macro variables and facilitates “big-data” research. We collect a total of 128 macro variables from the 2019:06 vintage of the FRED-MD database.10 The variable of ACOGNO, which is new orders for consumer goods, is excluded as this variable is merely available starting from February 1992. Consequently, we rely on 127 variables to forecast oil market volatility. The macro variables in the FRED-MD are classified into eight groups: (1) output and income (No. 1–16), (2) labor market (No. 17–47), (3) housing (No. 48–57), (4) consumption, orders, and inventories (No. 58–66), (5) money and credit (No. 67–80), (6) interest and exchange rates (No. 81–102), (7) prices (No. 103–122), and (8) stock market (No. 123–127). Two additional issues are noteworthy. First, we use the transformation codes provided by McCracken and Ng (2016) to ensure the stationarity for each used variable. Second, we take a one-month lag for many variables due to the publication delays.*"
